problem:

You will be given two arrays of integers and asked to determine all integers that satisfy the following two conditions:

The elements of the first array are all factors of the integer being considered
The integer being considered is a factor of all elements of the second array

Function Description is here:


Complete the getTotalX function in the editor below. It should return the number of integers that are betwen the sets.

getTotalX has the following parameter(s):

a: an array of integers
b: an array of integers


SOLUTION:

function getTotalX(a, b) {
    let validCount = 0;
    
    for (let x = 1; x <= 100; x++) {
        if (a.every(int => (x % int == 0))) {
            if (b.every(int => (int % x == 0))) {
                validCount++;
            }
        }
    }

    return validCount;
}
